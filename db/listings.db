Each engine has 3800 hours.  \nOther mechanical equipment includes a 2KVA Honda generator and a Pro500 80l/h watermaker.  \nOwner's comments: \nThe reason behind the two different engine sizes: \nTwo engines of 40hp at cruise will add 1knot, possibly 1.5 knots, to the boat speed at a larger fuel consumption rate / burn, - not a lot gained in speed to fuel cost ratio. \nThe M.D2020 at cruise will give a boat speed of 5- 6 knots with a fuel burn of 1.8 lt per hour. \nWe have found this to be great for motor sailing; in light airs we achieve 7-8 knots. \nThe real benefit of the 20hp motor is in the attached water maker that produces 80 lt per hour of freshwater. \nThrough the heat exchanger 40 litres of hot water becomes available. \nWith the 60 amp high alternator the 20 hp engine charges the house bank while making water, heating water and motor sailing at good speeds with low fuel consumption. \nThis Crowther 220 features all Hyde sails which were replaced in 2017, including: Main – sail area 65sqm (fat top), Headsail – sail on Facnor furler, Lee sails: Code Zero – sail area 68.sqm (Facnor furler). \nHer rigging was designed and supplied by Allyacht Spars and includes: spreaderless multi-stayed mast (18.25m anodised aluminium), Dyform stays: 3x 12mm upper stays, 3x 11mm intermediate stays, 2x 10mm lower stays and a Wishbone boom with three single line reef points. \nOwners comments: \nWindward performance: typically the yacht will hold 35 degrees apparent and a little closer when you get to know her. Having dagger boards allows better windward performance. \nWith the right conditions we can often obtain 1 – 1.5 knots additional speed over true wind speed. The code Zero is rated to 14 knots apparent wind speed. \nWe change sail plan (putting away the code zero) to the head sail around 12 to 14 knots apparent. The yacht is better balanced with less sail area and powers up better without any speed lost over ground.  \nSea state is another component that is factored in when selecting sail area; we reef early as we do not need a lot of sail area to maintain good speeds over ground. \nOn a reach, 50-55 degrees, we will get 8 – 9 knots  in 10 to 12 knots of apparent wind with main and headsail.  \nThe yacht excels in light airs and handles well in heavy weather due to the balanced rig and the Catana hulls.  \nTypically we can do 12 to 14 knots in the right conditions. We have sustained 16.5 knots up the West coast of Australia \nComfortable ocean passage making on the longer voyages we find our average speed is 8.5 knots. This was recently based on our 12 days sail from Langkawi to Maldive Islands. \nOn the PNG to Australia voyage we averaged 10 knots over the 3 day passage.                      \nAccommodation for 8 is provided within this Crowther 220 catamaran.  \nThere are two queen sized cabins with queen sized beds, spacious cupboards, Full hanging wardrobe with mirror, footlocker, Hella 2-speed fan, reading lights, Weaver hatches and portlights with insect screens. \nThere are also two double cabins each with a double berth, spacious cupboards, Hella 2-speed fans, reading lights and Weaver hatches and portlights with insect screens.  \nThere are two bathrooms featuring TMC electric heads and showers with hot and cold water.  \nThe spacious saloon on this Crowther 220 catamaran features a Tasmanian Oak table with height adjustment, and plentiful seating for guests. \nThe galley is situated upstairs and is well equipped with a Smev gas oven and grill, BEP gas monitor with alarm, NEC 750w microwave, double sink, 180l fridge with Danfoss compressor, 150l freezer with a Danfoss compressor, and plentiful storage.               \nThe spacious cockpit of this Crowther 220 features queen sized undercover day beds, plentiful seating with cushions, a large stainless steel BBQ, a built-in 80l icebox, and a hot and cold deck shower. "}

Just hop aboard and sail away, or stay to explore beautiful New Zealand! \nHer owners, a family from the US, purchased ‘Chasing Stars’ for an idyllic Pacific cruise, which took them to some of the most beautiful locations in the world safely and in ultimate comfort. \nThis beautiful yacht is currently for sale in Fiji and available now. Her owners have offered to deliver the boat for the buyers to Australia or New Zealand. \nThey write: ‘This fantastic cruising catamaran has just brought our family safely from the United States through the South Pacific! We are returning home and are sad to have to say goodbye to 'Chasing Stars'. She performed beautifully for us and will no doubt do the same for you. She is outfitted perfectly for blue-water cruising with plenty of solar, generator, water-maker, and all the necessary safety equipment. She sails fast and is extremely well laid out.’ \nMany agree that the Leopard 46 Catamaran easily outclass their similar size multihull competitors in terms of performance, durability and comfort.  The balance of interior and exterior usability, from the seamless transition between the extra-large cockpit and the plush saloon, level galley, wide traffic areas, intelligent use of the design for maximum and readily accessible storage, abundance of natural light, air flow, etc., are complemented by well above expectations quality, from the drawing board all the way to the finishing touches.  \nLeopards consistently provides higher quality materials, more sophisticated building techniques, and more robust engineering. Their attention to details is another factor which will keep your beloved boat or investment from deteriorating, such as, for example, the way interior timber furnishing are finished in a way to prevent water intrusion and discolouration over time, a method that is seldom used by other manufacturers.  \nAs cruising yachts, Leopards catamarans are truly hard to match in terms of speed, comfort and an ideal layout for families whose whole world will often be reduced to their ship for days of ocean passage, who will need to carry a vast amount of equipment and food without cluttering the boat, and who when they arrive at their destination will want to be able to enjoy a ship that is not just strong and seaworthy but also an ideal play platform. \n  \nThe Look: \nOne look at a Leopard Catamaran is enough to see that under it’s striking, almost feline lines, this yacht mean business. \nThe brainchild of highly respected South African boat builders Robertson and Caine, and designed by Gino Morelli and Pete Melvin (who drew the record-breaking maxi-catamaran PlayStation), it is easy to see that the boat is meant as a powerful, fast cruising yacht, perfectly suited to the more challenging environment of the ocean around South Africa and to safe and comfortable passage-making. \nThe Leopard 46 has high, almost plumb bows, which combined with the louvered forward window and rakish transom give a well-balanced, striking profile. The bows are narrow at the water-line and with a very fine entry to enhance performance. The elegant chines further define the lines and are pleasing to the eye, but are in fact designed to optimise the interior volume without slowing the boat down, and to provide a ‘shelf’ to reduce hobby-horsing as well as add reserve buoyancy in the seaway. The high bridge-deck is shaped to promote good adhesion to the water while encouraging performance and reducing ‘slamming’ in big seas as much as possible, something that boat owners with lower bridge decks sometimes complain about.  \n  \nThe cockpit: \nThe cockpit is big and comfortable, and offers various sitting, dining and relaxing areas. It is perfect for entertaining, with its huge table, pleasantly curving seats, lounges and easy access to the transom and aft deck. Every cruisers love their boat, but the Leopard 46’s cockpit is very often a subject of envy..! Perhaps it is the 25’ beam, which contributes to the sense of lateral space, and the way the interior lounge / saloon is positioned somewhat further forward, slightly reducing interior space but providing the most used part of the boat, the cockpit, with a huge amount of usable and versatile space.  \nTo add to the comfort is the adjustable hatch in the fibreglass Bimini, which opens forward to act as a wind scoop to provide a cooling breeze, a very nice feature in the tropics. 'Chasing Stars' 's cockpit is fitted with full weather protection covers.   \nThe helm seat is raised for good visibility and designed to be safe in all weathers. It is a winner for many cruisers who resent being up many steps in a flybridge, far from everyone else on board and away from everything. It allows for all the sailing to be done in situ, without need to venture on deck unless ready to dock or anchor.  \n  \nOn deck: \nThe leopard 46’s bows feature water tight compartments (ideal in case of collision), which are great for storing large water toys such as surf boards and other various equipment. One of these compartment has actually been fitted out as a crew cabin or additional berth, with a proper mattress and storage. It is reached by the overhead hatch or via a small opening door in the forward guest cabin.  \nAft of the trampoline is the windlass, water tankage, sail storage, and generator compartments. The distinctive and functional Leopard glass steps allow you to easily mount the rooftop to access the lazy-jacks and sail bag. \n  \nInterior: \nAccess inside is through sliding glass doors that essentially extend the saloon into the cockpit at the same level. Part of the galley counter folds out, enhancing this effect. The galley is in the starboard, aft part of the saloon. It is large, are and comfortable to use even at sea, and will be the delight of the resident chef with its full size stove, oven and grill, ample dedicated food storage, preparation areas and deep, double sink. \nThe dinette forward provides 360-degree views around the boat and seats eight in comfort. Three ports above the dinette in the forward part of the house open for good flow-through ventilation right through to the cockpit. \nThe interior's satin-finished cherry woodwork is attractive without being too warm. The laminate flooring used throughout presents in great condition and is easy to maintain.  \n‘Chasing Stars’ has the 4 cabins, 4 head layout, where the two aft cabins can be described as staterooms, with a Queen size island berth and ensuite head and shower which is of a generous size and enclosed by a proper and tastefully manufactured frosted glass door. The forward cabins have a semi-island double berth, access to the ensuite head and separate shower, and as for all the other cabins are fitted with ample designated storage lockers and hanging wardrobes.  \n  \nWatch this space! Additional photos and video walk-through will be added to this listing as soon as they become available. The boat is currently on the slip being antifouled and beautified, and will be ready for a full photo shoot in a week or so whether permitting. \n  \nFor more information please contact Anna at Nautilus Yacht Management. We would be delighted to chat with you more about the lovely 'Chasing Stars' and to arrange for an inspection with you, which is easily done as the boat is currently only 20 minutes from Nadi international airport. \n "}

A sturdy and solid sailing catamaran well suited to offshore cruising.Built in 2004 Calusa’s second owners are retiring from blue water sailing after nearly 10 years sailing some of the well-used routes of the world. To do this they converted Calusa from a coastal sailor to a blue water sailor. She is in ready- to -go mode. An upgrade to the propulsion the propellor is a fethering German made Variprofile VP-76/LH \nCalusa has been regularly maintained and serviced as she sailed from one season to the next. The 40 HP Yanmar diesel engines have run 5000 – 5200 hrs. The mast, sails and rigging are only 2 years old. Performance improvements have been gained by fitting feathering props, sails cut to sail better into the wind, the purchase of a 170 m2 Istec Parasailor spinnaker.The hull is made of composite fiberglass and balsa above the waterline and fibreglass below. The keels are sacrificial, and the rudders have the protection of a skeg. There are five Lewmar winches on deck that are powered by an electric hand-held drilling machine fitted with a bit that fits all the winches. This is driven by a Honda 2000 generator.The anchor is a 27kg Rocna on 200ft of chain and pulled up with an electrically controlled Lofrans Tigres 1500 anchor winch. \nThe helm is a wheel which is aided by a Raymarine autopilot. Navigational aids added include a Garmin chart plotter, Garmin Radar, depth sounder and wind instrument.The original canvas bimini over the spacious cockpit has been replaced with a fibre glassed ply top designed to also catch rainwater which feeds into 2 x 400 litres water tanks. The hard top is also fitted with 4 X 225 watt (900 watt) solar panels which meet most of the boat’s electrical needs. In times of bad weather, the engine, or the battery charger run by the Honda 2000, supplement.Calusa has a 110 watt electrical system and all equipment and tools on board fit this, including the air-conditioning system which runs off 110 watt shore power. \nCalusa has 4 double bedrooms each with a toilet/vanity/ shower. The kitchen and saloon lie adjacent to one another and the kitchen windows face forward so an eye can be kept on the sea there as well, when needed.The kitchen is fitted with corian tops, an LPG gas 2 burner top and oven as well as an built in fridge / freezer. The navigation table is in the saloon and sits below the switch board and panels fitted with the Ham/SSB radio, the pactor, the VHF , and a radio /cd player plus numerous charging stations. While she can sleep in excess of 8 people Calusa can easily be sailed by two people. It is noteworthy that the current owners were never bruised while sailing Calusa due to well thought out internal design. Calusa comes with her 2011 AB 9.5 inflatable dinghy. \nCurrently in Malaysia and is available for inspection by appointment only."}

The cat is considered one of the best that the company has produced. Sailing in the Belize 43 is exciting and effortless. \nThe cat’s length of 13 meters and a streamlined shape means it cuts through the water with ease. The Belize 43 is famous for its exceptional performance, which can be attributed to the generous sail area. \nThe interior of the Belize 43 is quite practical with a classy finish. Every part of the cat’s interior is covered with white and faux wood finishes. \nYou will also love all the small storage compartments cleverly placed in areas easy to reach. The gallery has a full cupboard with the most practical set up. \nAdditionally, you also have a fridge and a gas stove and oven as well as cutlery and other kitchen equipment. You will also want to take a look at the convivial dining area. \nThe FP Belize 43 has been designed to be as light as possible without having to compromise on stability. The construction was done using solid fiberglass in areas which require heavy duty parts such as the bottom of the hulls. \nThe cat was designed using a computer model that allowed the construction team to tinker with even the finest details. For this reason, the key stress areas were reinforced with additional layers of fiberglass. \nWith such a build, the cat is strong and stable yet light. This explains why it is so much fun to cruise in the Belize 43 because performance is maximized in every way possible. \nThe boat also has sacrificial mini keels and integral foam crash bulkheads which can protect it when an underwater collision occurs. The mini keels detach on the event that such a crash occurs. \nThe bridge deck clearance, proper weight distribution as well as the safe and enclosed cockpit make her much easier to handle in bad weather. This is also bolstered by the ease by which you handle the sails. \nThe boat is fitted with two Yanmar 3ym30 engines which also include an SD20-Saildrive, which in turn delivers the torque you need for choppy waters. The fuel tank holds a massive 300 liters (77 gallons) of fuel. \nOwing to the design aspects that went into the construction of this boat, you can already tell that it has undersail that makes for enjoyable cruising. \nYear: 2004Length: 43 feetBeam: 23 feetDraft (max.): 4 feetDisplacement: 11 tonnesMaterial(s): GRPArchitect(s): Joubert / \nwater tank: 600L \n2X30cv YANMAR 3ym30 diesel engine with gas filling oïl by the bridge \nA spare propeller \ndiesel tank: 300L, plus 104L for the generator  \nEngine hours on 1 March 2018 around 1800 h: Engine Tribord changed on 19/06/2008 (invoice to support) \nGenerator hours as of March 17, 2018: 1085h \nMain sail and Genoa season 2017 and its Lazy bag (stored without dry navigation) \nsquare outdoor sun protection - season 2017 \nwinch handle \"one touch\"  \nRigging (stays and stays) and turnbuckles season 2017 \nElectric windlass season 2017  \nBimini season 2015  \n60 meters calibrated chain season 2017 \nSpinnaker  with sock and deck hardware  \n5 service batteries of 185 amperes each season 2018 or 925 amps \nEngine battery 100Amp from Dec 2017 \nBattery Generator 100Amp from December 2017 (season 2018) - \nSemi-Rigid Annex with Aluminum Flooring AB -2011 \nHB engine 15hp 2 stroke and its 20L-2011- tank with its gas extender3 solar panels mounted on tiltable stainless steel frame of 185watts each mounted in 24 volts although the boat is equipped as standard with 12 Volts - season 2012 \n3 battery chargers (2 x 45 amps for service batteries and one for 30 to recharge the generator set)  \nFischer PANDA generator set of 4 Kva, laying, AND its dedicated tank of 104litres of Gas oïl, access filling by the bridge -2010- Group Hour on 1 March 2018: 1063h - \n2 O Tec Water maker  producing more or less 146 L / h -2010- \nMastervolt converter of 2000 watts 12 / 220v with remote control in the square - still guaranteed until December 2018 \nRaymarine electronics \nAutomatic pilot \nWind vane anemometer 2017 (season 2018) \nsounder \nelectric windlass control \nElectric winch control \nin addition to the commands next to each device \n2 GPS road plotters waterproof and installed, including a GPS MAP 5008 Garmin, with the possibility of carrying the cards inside on a flat screen of 55 \nAIS system TRANSMISSION and reception and installation  \nAnd a RYAMARINE - A50 of 2010 and pose \ncushions and LED lighting in the cockpit as well as a drawer us the table \nsun protection and rain protection  \nmosquito nets for portholes \nElectric winch for mainsail, genoa and winder and installation  \nInside. \nIn the redesigned square. \nVHF PRO OCEAN - RO 4800 with distress button and AIS with its portable VHF - season 2015 \nRAYMARINE Repeater \nAuto radio-CD player \n55 cm LG TV screen on hinge and VCR LG -2010 \nTV antenna on the second arrow bar  \n\"Bad Boy\" wifi antenna -2017 \nVHF portable standard horizon and its charger- \nGPS remote control \n\"Kannad\" personal distress beacon  \n2000 watts 12 / 220volt converter still under warranty until November 2018 - and one in 500 watt square  \n12 LED lighting and LED light bar  \npro expert load tester  \ngray navy sky square cushions  \nCooked: \n2 brand CAN -2010-VA 450E design lights \nconvection oven and electric microwave \nLarge fridge 100L air cooling \nDeep freezer 180L air cooling \nVarious kitchen equipment \nNespresso coffee machine \n  \nANCHORAGE \n60 meters calibrated chain 2017 (season 2018)  \nElectric windlass 2017 - (season 2018) \n1 anchor Delta- 450E \nand an aluminium anchor SPADE and its mooring with chain  \nPressurised seawater system in the anchor Locker with hose \nMast \nLED arrow bar lighting  \nFire damping at the head of mat LED \nFlash ligtht LED overhead (flashing light) \nStarboard float \nSaltted bed base  \nmattresses changed in 2018 for the aft cabin \nin bathroom WC 2018 \nin the front cabin \nwardrobe and additional storage \n\"Faure\" washing machine (5.5 kilos)  \nIce machine \nPort  float \nslatted bed base \nFront Cab \nadditional wardrobe and storage space \nWater maker 146 L / h \nlittle more: \nStainless steel ladder with four steps, three in the water with 3 wooden stepsplus a bath scale series \nMI,BEL43,MAR,MA"}
