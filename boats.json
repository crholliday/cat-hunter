    "description": "“CURRENT PRICE” IS A GUIDE.  ALL OFFERS RESPECTFULLY CONSIDERED. \nGeneral Description  Built on the success of the popular Moorings 4600 Catamaran, the all-new Moorings 4800 was designed in collaboration between The Moorings, architects Simonis-Voogd and builders Robertson & Caine.  Offering excellent performance under-sail and state of the art amenities; this yacht is the perfect vacation platform; ideal for 8 guests. Guests will enjoy a number of luxury amenities including a large forward cockpit with access to the main salon, an all-new design element that will be available, for the first-time ever, on a Moorings Yacht!  \nThe expansive main cabin features a full-entertainment center, a plush U-shaped settee, and a large dining table; all surrounded by windows offering 360-degree views of your beautiful surroundings.  The private guest staterooms are luxurious, bright, and airy with double beds, plenty of storage space for everything from swimsuits to evening attire, and en-suite lavatories with electric flushing toilets and enclosed stall showers. Since the yacht has a powerful generator sleeping in air-conditioned comfort while experiencing the wonders of a tropical paradise is assured.  The modern kitchen is second to none, with all that's needed to prepare gourmet meals that can be served at the table in the large cockpit shaded under a hardtop roof - the perfect setting for an al fresco dining experience or cocktails! The deck layout of the Moorings 4800 is ideally suited for relaxing, sunbathing, and swimming from the two-wide platforms at the rear of the yacht. A cross deck connects the two hulls, providing even more space to enjoy water sports of every kind, including; kayaking, stand-up paddle boarding and snorkeling.  The large deck area, at the bow, is an enchanting place to enjoy the quiet wash of the gentle waves against the hull as you sail the yacht to yet another exciting destination. Designed and built exclusively for The Moorings, the 4800 ranks as one of the finest charter yachts in the world!Actual Condition This is one of the better opportunities from the 48 X 4 R&Cs damaged in the Moorings fleet. She will need work but still has a lot left to start with. Veracruz III has 4-staterooms with 4 heads and TWIN 4 cyl Yanmars. We are told that she suffered damage about her hull, rails, and some in her cabin house. The helm top is on the deck. Port and starboard sides have rail damage, as well.  The engines are clean but some water was on the engine room floors; you may note the dipstick apparently shows little, if any, internal damage. The electrical panel appeared good; both outside and also dry on the backside.  The galley was complete as shown in the photos. The port and starboard hull staterooms do not appear to have suffered any major flooding and should clean well. Starboard staterooms stayed very dry. Generator and sail compartments visually appear to have stayed dry throughout the storm. There is no mast or boom, but the sail is shown in the photos. AGAIN, THIS IS ONE OF THE BETTER YACHTS FOR THIS TYPE OF PROJECT! Please inspect carefully before making an offer. *We always encourage potential Bidders/Buyers to view the item personally or have someone else inspect it for you prior bidding. It is entirely the buyer's responsibility to inspect and determine the vessel's actual condition. EquipmentA trailer is not included in this sale. Engines Please read Motors and Machinery Disclaimer. Motors and Machinery DisclaimerNo statement of condition can be made regarding motors, engines or machinery, whatsoever. A photo may appear of the engine compartment and machinery, but it is entirely the buyers responsibility to inspect and determine their actual condition.  \"VERACRUZ III\" VB /LAM "

Actual Condition It is reported this Sunsail 484 suffered damage in Hurricane Marina. There was water intrusion and flooding in the stbd hull, exterior and top side scuffing, and general damage. There appears to be several stanchions that are in good condition. The port hull stayed dry and appears generally clean and the cabins in the port hull show to be in good condition.  \nThe galley and galley equipment suffered some flooding and it is reported the freezer did get wet. The electrical panel seems to have stayed dry and looks useable. There are signs of some delamination on both port and starboard hull sides, and a patch on the stbd side. \nThe keels, props, and rudders appear visually undamaged and there is no gen set. One A/C, the mast, boom, and rig are missing, and the forward door is broken. Two sails were sighted on board, but not inspected.  \nShe is a much better yacht than she currently looks. A good cleaning will go a long way with this one! Look closely at the photos and they will tell a story.  *We always encourage potential Buyers to view the item personally or have someone else inspect it for you prior making an offer.

Its thin hulls disguise an impressive amount of interior space; the cockpit and saloon being on the same level. What is most impressive when you climb aboard for the first time is the huge saloon looking to the exterior, its U-shaped and spacious galley and the panoramic view. It is certainly one of the finest catamarans on the market. Built in La Rochelle, it has been the subject of constant improvement. Equipped with 4 double cabins and 2 fore peaks which can be fitted out, allowing berths for 12 people.\r\nMotivated seller."

The chart plotter is mounted aft at the end of the cockpit table which makes it easy for viewing by the helmsman.  \nThe forward cabin features an island-style queen size bed, dressing table and ensuite head. Two identical guest cabins are located aft. The roomy 2nd head is located conveniently at the bottom of the stairs to starboard and features a separate shower. \nThe U-shape galley is to port of the companionway - which is really handy under way or entertaining.  \nThere is a U-shaped settee draped around a handsome table to port with two seats on the centerline. The settee to starboard includes a removable armrest, allowing it to become a sea berth. The large portlights are covered with pleated blinds and the overhead hatches have sliding shades. \nThe hull is hand-laid fiberglass without a core and incorporates a molded structural grid or liner. A vinylester barrier coat helps prevent blisters. The deck is cored except under high-load areas where it is solid, beefed-up laminate. The main bulkheads are bonded through 360 degrees, providing torsional and compression strength. \n****Comprehensive Yacht Condition Index Report available to serious buyers***"

    "description": "This particular Bahia has been owned by its current owner for over 10 years and has spent its time cruising the Caribbean Islands, in that time the owner has made modifications over and above a standard Bahia which make sailing and living aboard easier and more comfortable. Its 3 electric winches make light work many of the jobs on deck including the sails. It has a large custom 11 CU freezer in the galley provides impressive frozen storage. Extra house batteries give ample power storage, and 2 large solar panels and 2 wind generators keep up with most power demand onboard. The vessel has 2 power inverters fitted to help keep the power usage on board efficient, a smaller one handles low demand items such as keeping phones and computers charged, and a larger one for the higher power demand items such as toasters, coffee makers or hair dryers and can be turned on as needed. A Northern Lights generator located in the Port engine compartment provides air conditioning via 3 Air conditioning units and also provides battery charging. 4 Bilge pumps with alarms keep you notified of any water in the bilge and the system also indicates which pump has activated. The crew bunk beds in the port and starboard companion-way have been converted into useful storage and also accommodate the water maker. The current owner has converted the Starboard forward cabin to a workshop and storage which is very useful if you plan to live aboard but could also be converted back into a cabin if the new owners prefer to have a 4th Cabin. The owner’s bathroom features an electric toilet and stand up shower. The boat comes with an impressive number of tools and spares included."

KISS – keep it simple, sailor – means spend your time enjoying the destination, not repairing systems! With a single daggerboard, single Yanmar with raiseable saildrive leg, and 2 queen cabins with their own heads, this vessel brings all the benefits of a sailing cat with none of the drawbacks –stable platform, flat, fast sailing, huge social cockpit, shallow draft, and the space for comfortable live-aboard/extended cruising without complex system repair and maintenance. \nExtensively cruised to the Kimberly, Whitsundays and other Australian destinations with full cockpit enclosure, large tanks,battery bank, solar, wind gen, genset and watermaker, this light, fast cat has proved herself easy to handle short handed. The single Yanmar reduces mechanical maintenance overhead, and the saildrive raises to reduce drag underway, minimise underwater entanglement/strike threat, and reduces maintenance by lifting clear of the water. In conjunction with her solid GRP hulls, daggerboard and kick-up rudders this also enables her to take the ground safely. \n2 cabin 2 head layout also enables a large workable galley, workshop area and plenty of stowage, with a forward deck lounging area providing a safe, social alternative to the cockpit or saloon, as well as excellent stowage for surfboards, kayaks, SUPs, etc. \n• 0.7m draft • Raiseable saildrive leg • Kick-up rudders • Watermaker • 600AH battery bank • 450W solar, 400W wind gen, and Honda EU20i genset • Huge saloon and vast galley • Workshop area • Dinghy with 2 outboards: Yamaha 3hp and Tohatsu 8hp • Electric dinghydavit winch \nThis comprehensively equipped, one owner vesselhits all the marks and she’s ready to go again – a very affordable, comfortable cruising cat with ample space and plenty of storage. Just bring your suitcase and plenty of sunscreen."

    "description": "LIVE SKYPE VIDEO TOUR OF THIS YACHT AVAILABLE ON REQUEST \n  \nThe Lagoon 440 was voted \"Best Charter Catamaran 2005\" by Cruising World Magazine and has proved to be one of the most popular and successful charter and cruising cats of all time. \nThe upper flybridge gives excellent all round visibility and with all lines led back to this position the boat can be sailed single handed! An electric halyard winch means easy hoisting for the powerful roached mainsail. A raymarine chart plotter and all instruments are close to hand. Alternatively the boat can be controlled under power using a joy stick at the navigation station in the saloon and switch over engine controls. \nThe vast, solid covered cockpit will seat 10 – Alize has a specially made GRP table for this purpose. The cockpit also contains an outside sink and fridge under for drinks storage. Under the seat is the massive 11KVA generator that supplies sufficient power for all the AC sets. \nFrom the cockpit a large sliding door opens to the saloon – again spacious seating with an L shaped settee and centre seat which also gives additional storage area for the galley. The galley has a stainless steel counter top with convenient access to the cockpit through a sliding hatch. A 3 burner stove, oven, microwave and stainless steel freezer and fridge units (new 2008) complete a very well equipped galley. The saloon has its own 16,000 BTU AC unit. \nThere are 4 well-appointed double cabins with plentiful hanging and storage space. The cabins are located in each aft and forward hull and each cabin is served with its own spacious shower and head. Each cabin has individually controlled air-conditioning unit. There is one additional crew cabin in the forward section of the port hull with its own head in the starboard hull. \nEach engine is accessed through its own hatch forward of the stern steps. Yanmar 50hp diesels with SD50 drive units and 3 bladed props give the boat great power. \nDuring the course of her management with Horizon Yacht Charters, Alize has seen many upgrades and revisions. An upgraded charging system with increased battery capacity (over 1,000Ah), deep cycle batteries (replaced 2012), high output alternators with external regulators, upgraded wiring and a 140A battery charger (for shore power or generator) have all been installed. A new mainsail was fitted in 2011 and the stackpack modified to make easier to zip up after use. All through hull fittings were replaced on 2010/ 11. New dinghy Oct 2013. The boat was re-rigged in Nov 2013. New outboard March 2014. Alize has been very carefully maintained in Horizon’s care since 2008 – full service records are available. \nOct 2014. Hull entirely stripped of antifouling, Interprotect epoxy barrier coat applied before applying new antifouling. Both sail drive diaphragms changed."

    "description": "This high-tec performance cruising cat has a superb pedigree, she was built by the famous Australian Multihull identity Geoff Cruse who is known for his range of Crowther Windspeed catamarans he built back in the 80’s and 90’s, his pioneering sailing and building of Multis in the early 70’s and in recent times as Australia’s leading Multihull expert and surveyor. \nFree Spirit has been built in foam wrapped in lovely yellow Kevlar and sealed and bonded in the best epoxy resin. This makes the boat very light and incredibly strong, the mast is a beautiful work of art in carbon fibre. \nFree Spirit is a big cat with a wide beam for stability and room below for family and friends, she has 2 x big double cabins, galley down in the starboard hull, plenty of fridge space. \nShe has done plenty of cruising to some of the more remote outer reefs of the Queensland coast as well as a number of Brisbane to Gladstone yacht races and has been a popular fun boat doing the casual WAGS race at RQYS in Moreton Bay and plenty of fun nights on board at the many cruising location within Moreton Bay. \nThe builder Geoff (Crusey) Cruse has always been the one who’s in charge of doing all the maintenance on her over the years. \nIt comes with a huge wardrobe of cruising and exotic racing sails. \nDon’t be fooled into thinking this is just a race machine, it’s an incredibly capable cruiser that can kick up her heels and average sparkling sea mile. Her Sister ship “Bligh Spirit” completed a cruising circumnavigation of the globe with a crew of 2. \nDon’t miss this opportunity to invest in this fun life style of a quality fast cruiser and racer at a bargain price. She is ready to sail away over the horizon."

Designed by Alexander Simonis, this South African-built Sail Cat was built for both performance and comfort.  \nANTARES was launched in January 2001 and was the very last Voyage 43 built.  Therefore, it has some of the features of the new Voyage 44 which superseded it in the production line.   \nThis particular NORSEMAN 43 was built with a unique \"hybrid\" layout that has 4 staterooms to accommodate a large owner's party, but instead of the usual 4 head compartments found on a Cat with a 'charter layout' it has just TWO head compartments with showers located midships; one in each hull.  Thus the layout is very open and roomy with out crowding the interior with the 'extra' 2 heads.  Also, the 2 head compartments are much larger than those found on a Cat which has the conventional 'Charter Layout'.    \nTherefore, there are essentially two equal \"Owner's Staterooms\" located aft in BOTH the Port and Starboard hulls. \nThe equipment list includes solar panels, water-maker, cruise electronics, dinghy w/outboard, electric anchor windlass, and Harken roller furling. The solar panels provide plenty of power to keep the refrigeration systems cold while underway or at anchor. \nANTARES was delivered NEW to the original owners, a German couple who then crossed the South Atlantic to Brazil and on up to explore the northern coast of South America, Panama and Central America, and most of the island nations of the Caribbean.   \nThis vessel is very well-equipped for cruising and living aboard, and the 3.2 ft draft makes it ideal for Florida and Bahama cruising.  \nAs a used vessel ANTARES is in very nice condition!  It has just been detailed inside and out, and the vessel has been left with us for an immediate sale.  \nANTARES has never been chartered and is set up for extended live aboard cruising and extended living aboard \"on the hook\".  \n  \nIf you are looking for a reasonably-priced, well-equipped and nicely-maintained \"go anywhere\" Sail Catamaran...your boat has arrived ! \n  \n  \n "

This custom hull laid with longer waterline mold to accommodate the 40 horsepower engines and anticipated extra mechanical equipment. This mold eventually became the 445 model. Most major suppliers to the charter industry in recent years have found it beneficial to tailor their products increasingly temptingly to the discerning private owner.

    "description": "The Belize is a very efficient sailboat and one of the fastest in her class. The sails are both easy to hoist and haul thanks to the genoa furler and to 2:1 mainsail halyard and the fully battened mainsail on ball bearing batten cars. The helm station is protected by a fixed plexiglass screen. Meticulous attention is paid to each detail for greater ease in sailing.  This boat was originally purchased by the current owners through a well known charter company ownership scheme and has been continuously in charter throughout her life. She is currently still in charter in the Grenadines and the new owners choose to leave her there and enjoy very low cost ownership. The current owners have offered to refund the charter fee for any prospective buyer who charters this boat and then decides to buy."

    "description": "This Boat has our DNA!      Here at the Multihull Company we were the global distributors and agents for Dolphin Catamarans and over the course of years sold over 24 of these catamarans. When the Global Financial Crisis hit we decided to shut down the shipyard in Brazil. The tooling for the boats remained there and her chief builder, Philippe Pouvreau, was asked to build a few Dolphins for Brazilians using those tools. FAU is one of these \"custom Dolphins.\"  While she is not identical and has some different looks and features, she is the same great sailing boat, and from talking with Philippe recently he assures me she is a fine boat that he built with pride. I am bilingual English-Portugese and have been in touch with her owner and Philippe, and therefore can answer any questions you might have on this very special listing at a superb price.  Dolphins have a proven yacht design, with more than a few safe circumnavigations.  For anyone looking to get a real sailing catamaran, that is a comfortable liveaboard as well, FAU has to be at the top of the list. \nCurrently enjoying the islands off the Panama coast on the Gulf, will pass by Cayman, Florida Keys and dock in Miami in February."

Manta catamarans have explored the globe and been loved by their owners so much that they have a special owners association. We are delighted to be offering Kapai to new owners to enjoy this elite group and live their dream. \nKapai has a large, comfortable cockpit with a wonderful swing seat mounted on the arch support giving helm-height views from the stern. The entire area is covered by an alloy bimini top, roll up side curtains and clears. \nInside, the saloon is spacious with galley up, a large working bench area, saloon seating and table. The surround view of scenery and activity is inspiring. \nKapai, like all Manta’s, is a three cabin, owner’s version; it has two double cabins plus a third with twin singles. The owner’s cabin has a full ensuite while the guest cabins share a centrally located shower and toilet. \nIn 2014 Kapai was fitted with a new sails and rig.

    "description": "SV Calusa is the classic Robertson & Caine 42 Leopard designed by Naval architects Simonis Voogd Design and constructed in the Cape Town South African boatyard of Robertson & Caine. A sturdy and solid sailing catamaran well suited to offshore cruising.Built in 2004 Calusa’s second owners are retiring from blue water sailing after nearly 10 years sailing some of the well-used routes of the world. To do this they converted Calusa from a coastal sailor to a blue water sailor. She is in ready- to -go mode. An upgrade to the propulsion the propellor is a fethering German made Variprofile VP-76/LH \nCalusa has been regularly maintained and serviced as she sailed from one season to the next. The 40 HP Yanmar diesel engines have run 5000 – 5200 hrs. The mast, sails and rigging are only 2 years old. Performance improvements have been gained by fitting feathering props, sails cut to sail better into the wind, the purchase of a 170 m2 Istec Parasailor spinnaker.The hull is made of composite fiberglass and balsa above the waterline and fibreglass below. The keels are sacrificial, and the rudders have the protection of a skeg. There are five Lewmar winches on deck that are powered by an electric hand-held drilling machine fitted with a bit that fits all the winches. This is driven by a Honda 2000 generator.The anchor is a 27kg Rocna on 200ft of chain and pulled up with an electrically controlled Lofrans Tigres 1500 anchor winch. \nThe helm is a wheel which is aided by a Raymarine autopilot. Navigational aids added include a Garmin chart plotter, Garmin Radar, depth sounder and wind instrument.The original canvas bimini over the spacious cockpit has been replaced with a fibre glassed ply top designed to also catch rainwater which feeds into 2 x 400 litres water tanks. The hard top is also fitted with 4 X 225 watt (900 watt) solar panels which meet most of the boat’s electrical needs. In times of bad weather, the engine, or the battery charger run by the Honda 2000, supplement.Calusa has a 110 watt electrical system and all equipment and tools on board fit this, including the air-conditioning system which runs off 110 watt shore power. \nCalusa has 4 double bedrooms each with a toilet/vanity/ shower. The kitchen and saloon lie adjacent to one another and the kitchen windows face forward so an eye can be kept on the sea there as well, when needed.The kitchen is fitted with corian tops, an LPG gas 2 burner top and oven as well as an built in fridge / freezer. The navigation table is in the saloon and sits below the switch board and panels fitted with the Ham/SSB radio, the pactor, the VHF , and a radio /cd player plus numerous charging stations. While she can sleep in excess of 8 people Calusa can easily be sailed by two people. It is noteworthy that the current owners were never bruised while sailing Calusa due to well thought out internal design. Calusa comes with her 2011 AB 9.5 inflatable dinghy. \nCurrently in Malaysia and is available for inspection by appointment only."

Custom Built in 2007 (completed in 2011), the Farrier-F41 Sailing Yacht is the epitome of performance, class and luxury. The F-41 is a performance cruising catamaran and the first 'two huller' from the renowned sport-tri designer Ian Farrier, owner of Farrier Marine in New Zealand. As with his definitive trimaran models, the F-41 is designed to be a safe, roomy cruiser, with outstanding speed and handling. Race-winning capability is central to Farrier's success, without sacrificing interior space, seaworthiness or structural integrity.  The high performance of the F-41 is achieved through the lightweight hull construction techniques and highly efficient rig, areas where Ian Farrier was able to draw on his vast past experience of designing and developing innovative multihulls. The F-41 is essentially a yacht cruiser and will appeal especially to those with experience of Farrier designs who now want to move up to a larger craft with more accommodation and facilities for live-aboard and long passage-making.  Sea Joy offers a comfortable four stateroom interior with two bathrooms equipped with showers. The sailing yacht also features a brand new kitchen, salon area with bench seating, electrical system, windows, stainless steel lifelines, and more.

    "description": "Soul Sacrifice, a 2003 Grainger 43 located at Kota Kinabalu (Malaysian Borneo), is now proudly and exclusively for sale with team YOTI Queensland. She is an Australian tax paid vessel. This is a great opportunity to buy a serious blue water cruising catamaran, with big ticket renewals of engines, sails a rigging already done! Of course, she comes with a Generator (6kw) water maker, good size freezer and washing machine ready to continue exploring even the remotest islands and locations. Soul Sacrifice was built by Ian Snell in Victoria and launched and commissioned in 2003. Her construction is of western red cedar and fiberglass. She has four cabins and two heads, with the galley midships in the starboard hull. The saloon has good size opening forward hatches for that important airflow. The navigation/electronics island is to port, and a large L shaped settee with table to starboard. All upholstery on Soul Sacrifice was replaced last year. The port forward cabin has a Queen size bed, overhead hatch, plenty storage cupboards and compartments. Forward of this cabin is separate large general storage locker (perfect for all the cruising gear) and water tight collision bulkhead. The starboard forward cabin also has a Queen-size bed, overhead hatch, plenty storage and an ensuite head and shower. There is additional storage forward of the shower water tight collision bulkhead. Midships in the port hull is a head and shower, accessible from both the front and rear side, making it also the guest/ day head. The port rear cabin is currently used for storage. This may be easily changed back to a regular double berth cabin. The Starboard aft cabin is converted into a utility space with the essentials for blue water cruising: a 6kw generator, 7kg front loader washing machine and 80ltr freezer. The large cockpit had a recent upgrade with a hard top with solar panels and has twin helm stations, with controls and plotter at the port helm. Mainsheet, genoa and screecher sheets are controlled from the cockpit and the mainsail hoisted and reefed at the mast. Her decks are uncluttered, with ample space for your SUP or kayaksThe transoms have clear access to and from the cockpit and the large stainless-steel arch functions as davits for the tender, with top mounted solar panels. Please contact Robert Vrind for further details on this great blue water cruising catamaran yacht, and to arrange an early inspection in Malaysia. (Kota Kinabalu International airport via Singapore or Kuala Lumpur)."

The yacht does come with the lake upgrade package which is worth in the region of €40,000 and includes various sail upgrades such as a huge genakker (136m2), reacher (116m2) only used for 10 days, main sail 6sq metres larger than the original and various other sail setups and ancillary equipment. Over the years the equipment has been developed and modified to make handling easier such as carbon fibre towers which allows the whole daggerboards to be lifted from the water. The list of upgrades and additional equipment is extensive and too much to list here but is available on inquiry. This is a fast yacht, capable of speeds in excess of 35 kn. and very responsive even in light winds. The yacht can sail under the original X40 class rules as each of the new parts is removable. Please note that the trailer is not included in the sale."

Forward of the head is the starboard stateroom with hanging locker. \nWe then go to the port hull an ample head and shower are in the center of the hull with the port stateroom aft of that and another stateroom forward with storage and lockers. \nThe helm station on the Lavezzi 40 is efficient and comfortable. A small windshield provides some shelter without obstructing vision, and all the controls operate smoothly. While the sheets do not all lead directly to the helm, it's only a short walk to reach the double-ended mainsheet or the genoa sheets. \nIt's easy to enter and leave the expansive cockpit, and the decks are wide with good handholds alongside the cabin. Big lockers forward will swallow the dock lines and fenders, and the anchor windlass can double as a power winch for raising the mainsail. \nFountaine Pajot has extensive experience in voyaging catamarans, and the Lavezzi 40 shows that heritage. This is a substantial cruiser with good performance and spacious accommodations. \nThe Fountaine Pajot LAVEZZI 40 offers excellent performance at sea, with awesome stability and a generous sail plan. Genoa winches positioned to keep the cockpit clear and open with ease of single hand maneuverability. Great under power or sail."

    "description": "Makaras owners had successfully circumnavigated in another catamaran some years ago, and chose the Lavezzi for their new adventure because of its outstanding sailing capabilities, especially in light winds compared to other catamarans of this size, and its comfortable salon and cockpit layout with good forward vision without the need for a flybridge. Makara benefits from many recent upgrades,including new engines, new sail-drives, and Flexofold 3 blade (best-of-breed) folding props. Her sailing capabilities have been enhanced by a new 6 batten mainsail, new genoa, and new Code 0 head-sail on a sprit. She has also been rerigged. Electrical upgrades include new networked NMEA2000 instrumentation including AIS, Radar and autopilot, two large solar arrays (900w), one array on an alloy arch that also supports a kayak, and one on the cabin-top, These feed a large golf cart battery bank (800 Ahr) and a highly efficient Spectra watermaker."

    "description": "FINALLY !  ONE OF  THE BEST DEALS AROUND!!! \n  \nA very  lightly chartered and very well kept example of one of these sought after cats. \nEasily the cleanest one available. ORIGINALLY by house proud Canadian marine professionals who use her as their  winter home  ( and to prevent boredom) their crewed charter vessel for 5 months of the year....averaging one charter a month... mainly with friends and charter  clients from  back home. \nThen we sold her to a Boston based Doctor who uses her for his family and friends and now that his family is getting bigger he wants a bigger boat! \n  \nShe has had her FP warranted bottom job done some years ago. \nShe represents excellent value for the discerning cruiser  looking for a clean well kept vessel to either putter around the islands  on or do some serious blue water cruising. \nBROKERS COMMENTS: \n  \nWe think this vessel represents a rare opportunity to acquire probably the best kept vessel of her type available today. When we tell you why, we think you will agree with us. \n  \n1)      Pretty much all of these four cabin Lavezzi’s and similar vessels ( Lagoon 410’s etc) were built for the charter market. \n  \n2)      They have been very successful. By 'successful' read “well used”….. Around 20 to 25 charter weeks a year. \n  \n3)      For seven years this means an average of 175 charter weeks all driven by charter ' credit card' captains / one week warriors with varying skills levels and thus the bulk of these vessels have had hard lives. \n  \n4)      They are ‘phased out’ after their charter lives when most charter companies  just give  the bulk of them them a lick and prayer of varnish and  repairs  and they are sold on. Some of the vessels are properly phased out and repaired by some of the companies…. To be sure. They have however still had their 175 weeks of charter. \n  \n5)       These vessels have had an average of 5 to 10 days a year out of the water when they have their annual bottom paint and repairs done. Time out of the water is far more expensive than time in the water on a mooring/dock…. Thus charter companies cut costs and increase profitability for themselves and the owners by minimizing this hard standing time. It averages a max of just under 2% of their lives out of the water. Clearly not good for any glassfibre hull. Few of these ever had the benefit of additional barrier coating. \n  \nThis vessel  was only ever in a charter fleet for three years of her life…. Far less than the average Charter company contract of 4 to 5  years… (and then into a second and third tier discount  fleets for the rest of their lives from whence they are sold.) \n  \nShe was bought at three years old by her previous owners ,  picky marine professionals from Canada who have a small charter company there. She is used as their winter getaway in the islands where they do around five  crewed charters  a year only. Every single hurricane season she has been hauled ( only with a travel lift… never a crane) and stored on the hard for the entire summer, whilst they return to reopen their Canadian operation. \n  \nSo she has benefited from the personal loving care of  these long term marine professional owners who have never let anyone else captain her…. And it really does show. \nThe new owner Doctor David bought her and took her North where she has been his summer Joy . \nHis family is expanding and he wants a bigger boat! \nShe has been constantly upgraded and  now awaits her new owners to live on and nurture her. \n  \n  \n  \n  \n Will you be the lucky one? \n  \n "

    "description": "The owner of this Lavezzi 40 is a serious seaman who has circumnavigated on his 60 foot Wharram and he has sailed half way around the world on his current Catana 58. He arrived in the Marshall Islands and fell in love with the island and her people and has involved himself in a range of humanitarian projects in the region. Arearea was purchased by him five years ago for use on a project that was recently cancelled, hence the reason for her sale. Prior to that cancellation the seller invested heavily in her with a number of refits as you can see in our listing. \nShe is being offered for sale on the island of Majuro, Marshall Islands. For the adventurous type, she can be purchased here and then sailed in almost any direction. But the seller of the boat can offer a pre-fix delivery price for people on his team to deliver her almost anywhere on her own bottom. A buyer could enjoy an island hop sail to Tarawa in Kiribati, then to Funafuti in Tuvalu, then on to Fiji, etc. Or a West Coast U.S. buyer could sail her to Hawaii and then on over to California, Oregon, or Washington state. The Lavezzi 40 is capable of making such sails and the boat is well equipped to do so. She is certainly an ideal purchase for anyone who wants a boat in the South Pacific islands, Guam, Fiji, or then on down to New Caledonia, New Zealand, or Australia.  \nPlease contact us with any questions. The seller of the boat is a longtime customer of ours and a good friend. He is a pleasure to deal with. She can he hauled and surveyed where she is, but advance notice will be required for us to have her out of the water for such an inspection. The nearest accredited surveyor is on the island of Guam and a buyer would have to fly him in, or of course any surveyor of their choice.  \nThe price for this catamaran, for her age, low hours, condition and equipment is excellent and has already been discounted to reflect her remote location.  \n  \n  \n "

Construction is fiberglass with epoxy foam with upgraded carbon fiber cross beams and high stress areas and was designed by Alan Carwardine and built by Roger Diggelmann."

    "description": "Dazcats Multihuls have been repeatedly proven both as racers and cruisers and they have competed in numerous international racing events, achieving class and overall wins in the Fastnet, Transatlantic, Round Britain and Ireland races, as well as many others. They have cruised the world in comfort and safety, and are built to be light and strong, taking you wherever you want to go in a unique and personalised synergy of style and function. This Cat was built by DAZCAT as an out-and-out blue water racing boat. Although she is currently used for cruising she has retained many of the state of the art features such as carbon fire spars and Dyneema rigging although the water ballast system has now need de-comissioned. Although built as a racing craft she has sizeable accommodation in her two hulls which include 2 double berths as well as two additional single berths. There are two heads compartments at the foward end of both hulls and cabin off the cockpit for shelter during the day. All the accommodation is functional although she would benefit from some cosmetic works to the interion. So if you are looking for a fast blue water cruising cat this should be on your list to view. These boat details are subject to contract. Note: Offers on the asking price may be considered. Visit our website for the full specifications of this boat with up to 100 photos, videos and virtual reality images."

She is ready and waiting for her new home. \n“Sarah” is one of the newest designs from the Peter Snell designed catamarans and named after his daughter Sarah. \nAt 12 metres, it’s still able to be powered by 2x high thrust 9.9hp Yamaha outboards. \nThe Easy Sarah features a high chine above the waterline. \nThe overall beam of this boat is the same as the 11.6, but the width is carried lower in the hull, resulting in more space at hip level inside the hulls. The hull flares just above the waterline are deeper at the bow than previous Easy designs with the stern longer and wider. \nThis boat also offers an even more protected cockpit than the others. \nStill manageable single-handed or short-handed, the gear is perfect for two people. \nThe current Owners have prepared a video for you to view “Oasis” on a recent voyage, enjoy! \nOne of my favourite things about this boat is her superb protected cockpit. \nKey features are: \n \n Queen bed portside with walk in wardrobe/storage. \n Good sailing performance and setup. \n Versatile galley with plenty of bench space. \n Many storage spaces. \n Protected undercover cockpit. \n 2 x 120W Solar Panels \n 4x200AH AGM House Bank \n Honda 2 KVA Genset \n Raymarine Electronics \n Webber Q BBQ \n Tender and outboard. \n Various spares. \n And much more… \n \nContact Multihull Solutions today to book your inspection! \n "

    "description": "   British designed and built, Prout Catamarans help shape the foundations for todays modern cruising catamarans. In 2014 this boat underwent a major refit including engine replacement and a new compact 6KVA generator with auxiliary 180 litre diesel tank. Since then Thida has been used to cruise extensively throughout SEA before returning to OMYC in May 2018. She has performed wonderfully throughout this extended cruise often completing three to four day single handed passages. Her easy to handle rig allows all sailing adjustment (except gennacker) to be performed without leaving the cockpit, and cruising at 6 knots on one 75HP engine is more economical than using the original two 29HP engines to obtain the same speed. Under sail the twin KIWI feathering props allow a comfortable 7 – 8 knots to be maintained with a maximum speed of around 9 – 10 knots under ideal conditions. \n "

    "description": "ON Y VA is a a highly sought after 3 cabin owners version Fountaine Pajot Lavezzi 40, with an impressive inventory offering buyers the opportunity to enjoy immediate blue water cruising adventures. \n  \nON Y VA is a rare opportunity to own one of the most successful catamaran models in Fountaine Pajot’s history, carefully maintained and upgraded by three fastidious owners. \n  \nThis boat has the optional grey interior which perfectly compliments the open view and like-new timber finishes. The additional locker spaces and inner spring mattress in this owners version create a comfortable home which has served the current owners cruising the east coast for the last four years. \n  \nBeing setup as an on-water home means items such as expresso coffee machine and microwave oven are standard, as is the Eno gas top and oven. \n  \nThe timber interior is in near-factory condition due to smart use of block out curtains which have avoided the sun washed look many similar boats exhibit. The lounge cushions and covers were new in 2016 and provide easy cleaning and comfort around the modified lounge table. \n  \nSailing performance is enhanced by the factory fitted prodder and furling gennaker which was pulled out of the bag brand new 4 years ago, despite being shipped when the boat was launched. This is a testament to how little use this boat has had and it is also reflected in the quality of the cruising main and furling headsail.  \n  \nCruising at 6-8 knots in 10-15 knots of  wind speed means easy distance on a daily basis. The Furuno plotter, radar and sounder provide easy control of this excellent boat. \n  \nCurrent owners replaced the targa and canvas factory bimini with a new custom hardtop in 2015. This enhanced the steering position by lifting the headroom by 200mm (without loss of sail area), making the boat even more spacious and manageable. The led light fittings are three position switches to supply red lighting for night transits and bright white for anchorage dining and relaxing. \n  \nSolar panels were replaced in 2016 with 200w panels coupled to an MPPT controller, delivering 15 amp of charge even on slightly overcast days. The boat draws little current with attention paid to led lights throughout, and low voltage equipment, including the Vesper AIS. \n  \nAt the same time, a custom kayak rack provides safe and easy ‘toy’ storage, as well a convenient towel rail for the external hot shower! Great for a quick rinse following the morning swim. \n  \nDelivering outstanding performance in offshore conditions, the Lavezzi 40 also succeeds in being an extremely safe, comfortable and elegantly designed catamaran. \n  \nIdeally suited to new boat buyers, ON Y VA will immediately appeal to those seeking a spacious catamaran with galley up, owners version, hard top bimini and much much more. She promises carefree cruising in local or blue water destinations, with all creature comforts to accommodate couples or families in style. \n  \nThe Lavezzi 40 has been hailed as the benchmark for cruising catamarans with its innovative layout, advanced technology and superior offshore handling. The catamaran features an extremely open and airy saloon with an aft facing semi-circular galley. \n  \nA large opening hatch combined with the off-centre door transforms the galley into an integral part of the cockpit; one level from the time you step up from the transom. The layout is a superb advantage in Australia’s warmer climate. \n  \nWith waterproof cushions and a slightly smaller custom cockpit table, the cockpit space is perfect for entertaining. If the need arises the original table for cockpit and lounge come with the boat to extend back to factory original. This would suit the supplied mattresses to turn either lounge or cockpit into a comfortable day or overnight bed. \n  \nON Y VA has been competitively priced to meet the current market and requires no further expenditure. This is an outstanding catamaran that is ready to set sail and delight her new owners. She presents like new! \n "

The galley-up design incorporates a spacious saloon and aft facing galley. No steps up or down anywhere. This yacht features a special alternative accommodation plan with a 4-cabin/2-head design. Two large double cabins with a shared bath fill each hull. There’s generous headroom throughout and substantial storage capacity provided by under-bunk lockers.. Sailing the Leopard 39 is easy: both main and jib sheets lead to stoppers and self-tailing winches directly adjacent to the helm. There’s room for two on the bench-style helm seat, but you need only one to trim sails! \nBROKERS REMARKS:  Cyel & Mer is the rare four cabin version for the Leopard 39.  With this layout it should be hugely desirable for families looking to cruise in comfort, or as a revenue generating charter yacht.   Great engines and solid generator, for air conditioned luxury on the water. \nAVAILABILITY : Due to be released from the St Martin fleet 31st March 2019. Possibility of an early release. Please inquire."

    "description": "New listing Aug 2018 \nAt one time the Catana catamarans built in this era were the ones to have! Built using Twaron Carbon Fiber for weight saving making a light, fast catamaran with the benefit of daggerboards giving an unbelievable shallow draft that could sail in a puddle and enabling the catamaran to get much closer to the wind. \nWith her unique “tulip” style hulls cutting through the water effortlessly added to this already great performers abilities \nA unique safety feature promoted by Catana was that in steep seas the catamaran could slide down a wave sideways without tripping on the keels. \nUnlike many of the production catamarans at the time, these performance cruisers offered better build quality and came with many optional extras included in the sale. \nSize wise this boat is an ideal Mediterranean cruiser, small enough to get into shallow berths in marinas and bays where others fear to tread, but equally a competent ocean crosser taking you wherever you want to be. \nThis is a rare weapon and ready for new adventures on the high seas! This one will not stick around!"

A mooring berth in the Mediterranean until September 2019 is included in the price."

This is a great looking yacht and she's beautiful inside - lots and lots of space for family, equipment and belongings for longer, blue water cruises. Her interior is extremely light and spacious - opening hatches and port lights everywhere and very generous cupboard space. Her saloon is vast, with a great nav station and galley - all with a fantastic all round view - these really need to be seen in person to be appreciated. She was the subject of a major refit in 2016-2017, which brought her right into the here and now - lots of replacements and improvements - see the ad for more detail. All-in-all, we really recommend viewing this yacht to appreciate just how lovely she is and what she has to offer you. These boat details are subject to contract.

She is well equipped, in perfect mechanical order, and looks lovely. \nShe is a four cabin, two central head, galley-up version of this popular catamaran with the current owners converting the forward port cabin into a great workshop/storeroom.  They have updated her along the way to make her a most comfortable, well set up cruising catamaran perfect for a couple or small family. The Admiral 38 is a very large 38 footer - she has high volume hulls, great beam, and a really spacious salon, as well as aft cockpit. Of the cats in this size range the Admiral is the most \"ocean going\" in my view - these cats are capable of sailing around the world, not only because they have large payload capacity, but great free-board, solid construction, and powerful Spar-craft rigsReady for new owners!!!"

    "description": "This latest design was made specifically for easier sailing by a crew with modest experience, with particular reference to the charter market and those who sail only occasionally. With the new rig being 3m shorter than the original design and 60cm narrower in the beam, the boat can be sailed comfortably and safely by two persons. \nDespite these modifications, the design caters for those who like to mix some racing with their cruising. The hull design is sleek with very little rocker so it doesn't drag water. Because of the impact on the buoyancy of the hull design, weight is a key factor but despite some material modifications to the original design for strength and durability, the Andaman Cabriolet still weighs in at just 3,000Kgs lightships (racing trim). \nAnother special feature of the boat is its retractable saloon roof. The Andaman Cabriolet's wide open, spacious saloon and cockpit gives the option of sailing 'al fresco' for all on board, without crowding in the cockpit area or being cut off in the saloon from the action. \nAt the same time, the saloon can be sealed off from the elements with the retractable saloon roof and side screens, perfect for those times when you have extra guests on board using the drop down saloon table/extra berth configuration. \nThe vessel has recently undergone extensive refitting, including a rebuild of both motors and a full paint job. With this refit and the recent price reduction (March 2018), it makes her an extraordinary value. It won’t be on the market long, so inquire for more information and schedule a time to take a look. More photos and videos are available."

This explains why they were so popular in Australia, and why they cost much more to build than the typical production catamaran. She offers superior lightweight foam core construction with solid vinyl ester resin below the waterline.  \nFrom 2004 to 2013, First Light had wintered on the hard under her cover. She was used lightly during the Summer seasons. First Light is Hull #9 in the very popular LW38 series built by Lightwave Yachts in Australia and boasts a voluminous and comfortable interior with tons of storage. Her smart salon design, excellent galley-down that remains open to the salon, her owner's berth, large standing shower, etc., set her apart from most other 38' catamaran options. She even sports excellent underwing clearance, so she will not only be faster underway (owner has sailed her at 21kts), but will not pound or bang like so many other catamarans. \nFirst Light has been well-cared for by her previous and current owners. She was originally owned in Cape Coral, FL, when her second owner purchased her and moved her to New York. Her second owner was a surgeon, who spared no expense in caring for her with special attention to detail. When her current owner, an engineer and USCG Captain, purchased her in 2013, he followed suit. It is CLEAR that this boat has been maintained to near perfection, and you do NOT want to miss your chance to see her. The current owner sailed her down the East US Coast and around to Tampa Bay, where she currently resides. He is ready to move onto his next yachting adventure, and needs to find her a new home. \nCall me today to set up an appointment, and be prepared to be amazed! \n "

    "description": "“CURRENT PRICE” IS A GUIDE.  ALL OFFERS RESPECTFULLY CONSIDERED. \nGeneral Description  LEOPARD 48 GENERAL INFORMATION, AKA-Moorings 4800, as presented in the \"Robertson and Caine International Yacht Pty Ltd.\" Owner's Manual, the following specifications will give you an idea of the yacht dimensions. This VARIES from year to year, but in general all are very similar.   Built on the success of the popular Moorings 4600 Catamaran, the all-new Moorings 4800 was designed in collaboration between The Moorings, architects Simonis-Voogd and builders Robertson & Caine.   Offering excellent performance under sail and state of the art amenities, this yacht is the perfect vacation platform - ideal for 8 guests. Guests will enjoy a number of luxury amenities including a large forward cockpit with access to the main salon; an all-new design element that will be available for the first-time ever on a Moorings yacht!   The expansive main cabin features a full entertainment center, plush U-shaped settee, and large dining table - all surrounded by windows offering 360-degree views of your beautiful surroundings. The private guest staterooms are luxurious, bright, and airy with double beds, plenty of storage space for everything from swimsuits to evening attire, and en-suite lavatories with electric flushing toilets and enclosed stall showers.   Since the yacht has a powerful generator sleeping in air-conditioned comfort, while experiencing the wonders of a tropical paradise, is assured. The modern kitchen is second to none, with all that's needed to prepare gourmet meals, which can be served at the table in the large cockpit, shaded under a hardtop roof - the perfect setting for an al fresco dining experience or cocktails!   The deck layout of a Moorings 4800 is ideally suited for relaxing, sunbathing, and swimming from the two wide platforms at the rear of the yacht. A cross deck connects the two hulls, providing even more space to enjoy water sports of every kind, including kayaking, stand-up paddle boarding and snorkeling.   The large deck area, at the bow, is an enchanting place to enjoy the quiet wash of the gentle waves against the hull as you sail the yacht to yet another exciting destination. Designed and built exclusively for The Moorings, the 4800 ranks as one of the finest charter yachts in the world!  Actual Condition This is one of the boats where the hulls are in good condition, with mostly only scratches and some gouges. The starboard engine was submerged and the port only 1/2 wet, but has some parts missing.   The condition of the generator is unknown. There are 2 sails, a boom and a broken mast. The electrical panel appears usable. There isn't a stove, and the condition of the fridge is unknown. The props and rudders appear good. It looks like only 1 of the air-conditioners got wet. Only 1 side got wet, and you can see the stains in the heads as to how high the water got.  \nA VERY REPAIRABLE BOAT... Look closely at the photos and they will tell the story.  \nInspect before making and offer and a minimum bank wired deposit is required with your offer.  *We always encourage potential Buyers to view the item personally or have someone else inspect it for you prior making an offer. It is entirely the buyer's responsibility to inspect and determine the vessel's actual condition."

    "description": "Well presented 4 cabin, galley up version, ‘Private Party’ was built in South Africa by Robertson and Caine. Their strong build quality and ocean sailing capabilities make this catamaran a self-sufficient blue-water cruiser. \nPrivate Party was placed into the Moorings in Hamilton Island for 3 years after her build. She was then refurbished in 2014/15 including new Yanmar engines only( 108 HRS) and antifouled in 2018.  She is now located at our Multihull Solutions Gold Coast Sales centre at The Boat Works in Coomera Gold Coast. \nThe hulls are built of GRP construction with balsa core and solid glass along the centreline, for strength of structure as well as insulation. The innovative stepped hull design increases volume while minimizing the wetted hull surface, giving exceptional load carrying capacity and maximum performance for its size and weight. Fixed skegs protect the rudders, also offering excellent attachment points for the rudder shaft. The vessel can easily be beached. \nThe Leopard is well set up for living onboard with 4 cabins, a roomy saloon and spacious cockpit for entertaining family and friends. \nFeatures: \n \n Twin 40hp Yanmar engines        (new 2015 - 108hrs) \n Twin 80amp alternators per engine (320amp) \n Generator YANMAHA EF2400is inverter \n Waeco  inverter MSP2012 \n Custom hard top canopy with sail view  2015 \n CLEARS and SUN SHADE to cockpit  2016 \n SEAT CUSHIONS to cockpit  2016 \n HOT and COLD aft deck shower SSI \n 4 Solar panels to hard top  2015 \n LED lighting throughout   2015 \n 4 New house and 2 engine batteries  2018 and 2016 approx \n Battery monitor ( ELITE  ENERDRIVE ) \n New hatch  COVERS  throughout with blinds and netting \n BLINDS to saloon and bedrooms (not fitted) \n LOWRANCE  HDS10 chart plotter  2012 \n Raymarine  AUTOPOLIT \n Raymarine WIND \n Raymarine TRIDATA \n Horizon 135 compass \n Yanmar TWIN  DELUX INSTRUMENT PANELS \n 1 ELECTRIC WINCH Hutton with twin foot control \n MP3  CD AW Player with internal and external speakers \n TV (vision) with new aerial 2015 \n NEW FORCE 10 2 burner oven \n MICROWAVE OVEN \n ICE MAKE R portable \n SAILS were replaced 2014 \n New chain fitted 2018 \n RIGGING revamped and checked 2015 \n SEA cocks renewed 2018 \n OUTSIDE painted 2015 \n \nPrivate Party deserves inspection."

The boat was fully equipped and in fairly good condition. We bought the boat to sail around the Cyclades in Greece. That is what we have been doing for the last three years, Kea, Evia, Andros, Tinos, Mykonos, Delos, Rineia, Paros, Siros, Kythnos, Serifos, Sifnos, Mylos, Aegina, Poros, Hydra and more...  We loved this area and it was all possible with the boat.

    "description": "For Sale: Sonra, a spectacular, well proven, well sorted, Fusion 40 sailing catamaran. She is that ‘one-of-a-kind’ you hear about. Built by The Cat Factory as their Demo catamaran, she showcased the companies’ exemplary boat building abilities in light strong catamarans.  As a Fusion Approved builder, The Cat Factory produced many other high-performance catamarans and was well respected for build quality in Australia.  \nSonra has the equipment required for extended cruising, is strong and lightweight, so when you arrive you can race around the cans with success. The South East Asian circuit beckons and Sonra is ready to go. \nExtremely well laid out using the best Fusion experience, along with the builders’ expertise, this shining example of the design has had her features copied in other Fusion 40’s. Her interior look is clean, uncluttered and sophisticated with a quality well above most. Recent new Solar panels and an up rated Inverter mean proper coffee can be brewed.  \nShe is currently on the west coast of Australia and can be sold with a berth, should she be required to locate to the east, a delivery crew can be organised to make re-location arrangements.  \nPlease see below in the Multihull Solutions webpage her complete inventory and make an offer on or close to asking and she can be yours. For more information, please contact Charles Robinson on the team at Multihull Solutions. \n "
